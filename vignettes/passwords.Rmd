Special character passwords containing backslash `\` do not work out of the box due to how R and URLs handle them. Backslashes are special characters that mean escape in R. There are multiple ways to handle a backslash in your password, but they need to be handled when creating the initial connection to Robin Hood.

Here are 3 ways to deal with backslashes in passwords:

  - For R 4.0 and greater the special strings function `r"()"` will ignore escapes
  - Use an escape charater `\` to have R read the backslash as a string
  - Web browsers browsers interpret `%5C` as a backslash, and ignore a literal backslash


```r
library(RobinHood)

# If the true password is: abc\def

# The following inputs will all work
RH <- RobinHood("username", pwd = r"(abc\def)")
RH <- RobinHood("username", pwd = "abc\\def")
RH <- RobinHood("username", pwd = "abc%5Cdef")
```
